This OS will be successor to previous Windows Phone 7 series as it contains biggest improvements that everybody wanted. The Windows Phone 8 announcement was aimed largely at Microsoft’s ecosystem of developers and hardware partners, and somewhat at potential enterprise customers, more so than at smartphone consumers. While the company’s executives revealed several end-user and consumer features–like the Wallet Hub, a new Start screen, upgraded hardware support (including support for NFC)–the major news revolved around the operating system’s revamped kernel, which it now shares as common code with Windows 8.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-06-20-windows-phone-8-announced-big-roll-up-in-the-tech-industry/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2012-05-03-ux-guidelines-for-metro-app-development/>UX Guidelines For Metro App Development</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2012-05-03</span></div><div class=post-content>The Windows Developer Preview introduces a new development platform for creating Metro style apps.

“Metro style apps are full screen apps tailored to your users’ needs, tailored to the device they run on, tailored for touch interaction, and tailored to the Windows user interface. Windows helps you interact with your users, and your users interact with your app.”

Personally, I enjoy using those because of the tremendous performance gain compared to WCF services. One topic, however, seems to be rarely covered when it comes to TCP-based communication between the server (presumably running on a desktop machine) and the client (Windows Phone) = transmission of large amounts of data.
A lot of existing samples assume that the communication, although bi-directional, is done with small data units.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-03-25-tcp-based-sockets-on-windows-phone-with-support-for-large-amounts-of-data/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2012-03-11-just-downloaded-visual-studio-11-beta-to-give-it-a-try/>I Just Downloaded Visual Studio 11 Beta To Give It a Try</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2012-03-11</span></div><div class=post-content>Microsoft has released betas of its various Visual Studio 11 editions – Ultimate, Premium, Professional, Test Professional and Express – along with Team Foundation Server and the .NET Framework 4.5.

Tonight I pushed to GitHub ‘mpns’, a simple interface and helper to the Microsoft Push Notification Service (MPNS).
