This OS will be successor to previous Windows Phone 7 series as it contains biggest improvements that everybody wanted. The Windows Phone 8 announcement was aimed largely at Microsoft’s ecosystem of developers and hardware partners, and somewhat at potential enterprise customers, more so than at smartphone consumers. While the company’s executives revealed several end-user and consumer features–like the Wallet Hub, a new Start screen, upgraded hardware support (including support for NFC)–the major news revolved around the operating system’s revamped kernel, which it now shares as common code with Windows 8.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-06-20-windows-phone-8-announced-big-roll-up-in-the-tech-industry/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2012-05-03-ux-guidelines-for-metro-app-development/>UX Guidelines For Metro App Development</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2012-05-03</span></div><div class=post-content>The Windows Developer Preview introduces a new development platform for creating Metro style apps. What is a Metro style app you say?
“Metro style apps are full screen apps tailored to your users’ needs, tailored to the device they run on, tailored for touch interaction, and tailored to the Windows user interface. Windows helps you interact with your users, and your users interact with your app.”
One of my friend asked me where one could find Design Guidelines for Windows 8 Metro apps.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-05-03-ux-guidelines-for-metro-app-development/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2012-04-22-silverlight-technology-in-web-application-development/>Silverlight Technology in Web Application Development</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2012-04-22</span></div><div class=post-content>Microsoft Silverlight is the realization of the .NET Framework supported by various browsers and platforms and intended for .Net software developers to create and present multimedia and RIA applications of the new generation in the Internet.

I want you all to sit in front of Windows 8, and explore it some more and get to be intimate with “metro” as a user interface style. Really, immerse yourself in it and just stare at it, explore every pixel it offers up.
I now want you to imagine that this is going to be your user interface for the next 5 years.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-04-05-the-problem-with-metro-is-its-hard-to-differentiate/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2012-03-25-tcp-based-sockets-on-windows-phone-with-support-for-large-amounts-of-data/>TCP-based sockets on Windows Phone with support for large amounts of data</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2012-03-25</span></div><div class=post-content>Network communication through sockets is a welcome addition to the Windows Phone platform. Personally, I enjoy using those because of the tremendous performance gain compared to WCF services. One topic, however, seems to be rarely covered when it comes to TCP-based communication between the server (presumably running on a desktop machine) and the client (Windows Phone) = transmission of large amounts of data.
A lot of existing samples assume that the communication, although bi-directional, is done with small data units.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-03-25-tcp-based-sockets-on-windows-phone-with-support-for-large-amounts-of-data/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
