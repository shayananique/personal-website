That’s true I am hacking around Windows 8 story since the first Developer Preview version come out, Now I am running Windows 8 Pro (RTM) on my All machines because I am in love with it. Currently, I am porting my Matchem Poker game and Sound Recorder application for Windows Phone to Windows 8. I am using a smart program called “MonoGame”.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-09-09-lets-start-windows-8-development/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2012-04-22-silverlight-technology-in-web-application-development/>Silverlight Technology in Web Application Development</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2012-04-22</span></div><div class=post-content>Microsoft Silverlight is the realization of the .NET Framework supported by various browsers and platforms and intended for .Net software developers to create and present multimedia and RIA applications of the new generation in the Internet.

Personally, I enjoy using those because of the tremendous performance gain compared to WCF services. One topic, however, seems to be rarely covered when it comes to TCP-based communication between the server (presumably running on a desktop machine) and the client (Windows Phone) = transmission of large amounts of data.
A lot of existing samples assume that the communication, although bi-directional, is done with small data units.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-03-25-tcp-based-sockets-on-windows-phone-with-support-for-large-amounts-of-data/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2012-03-11-just-downloaded-visual-studio-11-beta-to-give-it-a-try/>I Just Downloaded Visual Studio 11 Beta To Give It a Try</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2012-03-11</span></div><div class=post-content>Microsoft has released betas of its various Visual Studio 11 editions – Ultimate, Premium, Professional, Test Professional and Express – along with Team Foundation Server and the .NET Framework 4.5.
And of course it’s no coincidence that the latest version of the IDE has arrived on the same day as the Windows 8 Consumer Preview. Visual Studio is all about developing for Windows 8, and its integrated tools for publishing directly to the new Windows App Store will make it much easier for developers to reach a potentially huge market.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-03-11-just-downloaded-visual-studio-11-beta-to-give-it-a-try/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2012-01-04-matchem-poker-a-great-poker-game-for-your-windows-phone-2/>Matchem Poker: A Great Poker Game For Your Windows Phone</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2012-01-04</span></div><div class=post-content>I am pleased to announce that my game is called “Match`em Poker”. It is a poker game for Windows Phone 7.5 Codename: Mango and it is now available for free on Windows Phone Market Place. I hope to share a lot of my exciting developing experience on this blog.
On top of being a fully functional, free poker game, I’ve also made sure to address key complaints That I heard from people regarding the previous poker and cards game on market place: the main function of the game, that is general touch responsiveness than any other game present on Market Place.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-01-04-matchem-poker-a-great-poker-game-for-your-windows-phone-2/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2022 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
