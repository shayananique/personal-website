This OS will be successor to previous Windows Phone 7 series as it contains biggest improvements that everybody wanted. The Windows Phone 8 announcement was aimed largely at Microsoft’s ecosystem of developers and hardware partners, and somewhat at potential enterprise customers, more so than at smartphone consumers. While the company’s executives revealed several end-user and consumer features–like the Wallet Hub, a new Start screen, upgraded hardware support (including support for NFC)–the major news revolved around the operating system’s revamped kernel, which it now shares as common code with Windows 8.</description><content>&lt;p>Today at Windows Phone Summit Microsoft announced there upcoming version of Windows Phone known as Windows Phone 8 Codename “Apollo”.

What is a Metro style app you say?
“Metro style apps are full screen apps tailored to your users’ needs, tailored to the device they run on, tailored for touch interaction, and tailored to the Windows user interface. Windows helps you interact with your users, and your users interact with your app.”
One of my friend asked me where one could find Design Guidelines for Windows 8 Metro apps.</description><content>&lt;p>The Windows Developer Preview introduces a new development platform for creating Metro style apps. What is a Metro style app you say?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of my friend asked me where one could find Design Guidelines for Windows 8 Metro apps. Bonny Lau, from the Windows team, shared a terrific link to the new &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/">Windows Dev Center&lt;/a>, outlining comprehensive guidelines from planning to building your Metro style app. These guidelines also cover new UI lingo (app bar, charms bar, snap view, etc.), animations, and more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>“Match`em Poker”&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, my Game is called &lt;a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-GB/apps/081f188d-fe71-4015-b568-b4f1186bf039">Matchem Poker&lt;/a>. Instead of focusing on just raw performance from a development&lt;/p>
&lt;p>standpoint, I wanted to show how I would envision a great Windows Phone Game. I believe that for a v1.0. release, I have delivered a great initial app experience. I decided to try and demonstrate a happy compromise, hoping to yield a wonderful experience that doesn’t take short-cuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>· Touch Responsive&lt;/p>
&lt;p>· Great Performance&lt;/p>
&lt;p>· Improved Gestures&lt;/p>
&lt;p>· A Beautiful Experience, yet differentiated enough&lt;/p>
&lt;p>· A emphasis on Design&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(The name? It’s a little odd yet creative. The intersection of poker (Matchem) and the fun of the game This means to match the poker hands).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An emphasis on design and rich Visuals The design system for Windows Phone, code-named “Metro”, really is cool. Others have written about the experience before, but it really is a very developer-friendly design system that is crisp, clean, and once you understand the core principles and rules, it’s easy to build jaw-dropping apps. I’m just a geek, but feel I’ve come away with a pretty good first release when it comes to visual consistency and trying to adhere to the basics of “Metro”. This comes through in a few ways. If you look to the screenshots below, on the left, you see the nice visuals in the “Start” listing: no rounded corners, crisp and clean, etc. On the right, the “info” item for a page shows a few large, rich photos from the venue – and clicking them brings up the fullscreen experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://shayananique.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/clip_image004.jpg">&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/a>                                             &lt;a href="http://shayananique.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/clip_image006.jpg">&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A fun experience&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Playing the Game the feature you get is that on every level you will get general information on Poker which is quite good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>An update with specials is coming soon&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that the app is out there, an update coming soon will add specials support, and I’ll also work to address any large buckets of customer-reported bugs. Thanks to getting the build out earlier in the week for people with developer unlocked phones, I’ve been able to start identifying a few small bugs and issues that I hope to correct soon (thanks everyone).&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>From a Blank Visual Studio Project…. &amp;lt;90 Days&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I have created a visual studio project few months before purchasing my windows phone I have completed building and coding my game the thing which last is to test on actual windows phone 7 device the advantage of this is that you will not need to worry about any objection from Windows Phone Marketplace team you can review your and fix all the bugs you found during debugging on a device although, you can run it on emulator but many features would not work on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally I got my windows phone (HTC HD 7) and I am very happy after that I registered a domain &lt;a href="http://www.shayananique.com">shayananique.com&lt;/a> and added everything about my game on my blog I have also previously mentioned about my Invasion (game for windows phone) on my blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most development happened in spurts as I found a free Sunday afternoon or a clear night or two. I’m Really glad that I was able to the have the opportunity to build a feature-complete WP app and that Microsoft is open to this kind of project as appropriate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, check out the site and &lt;a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-GB/apps/081f188d-fe71-4015-b568-b4f1186bf039">download&lt;/a> the app from marketplace if you’re into Windows Phone&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
