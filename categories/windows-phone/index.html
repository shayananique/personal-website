This OS will be successor to previous Windows Phone 7 series as it contains biggest improvements that everybody wanted. The Windows Phone 8 announcement was aimed largely at Microsoft’s ecosystem of developers and hardware partners, and somewhat at potential enterprise customers, more so than at smartphone consumers. While the company’s executives revealed several end-user and consumer features–like the Wallet Hub, a new Start screen, upgraded hardware support (including support for NFC)–the major news revolved around the operating system’s revamped kernel, which it now shares as common code with Windows 8.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-06-20-windows-phone-8-announced-big-roll-up-in-the-tech-industry/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2012-03-25-tcp-based-sockets-on-windows-phone-with-support-for-large-amounts-of-data/>TCP-based sockets on Windows Phone with support for large amounts of data</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2012-03-25</span></div><div class=post-content>Network communication through sockets is a welcome addition to the Windows Phone platform. Personally, I enjoy using those because of the tremendous performance gain compared to WCF services. One topic, however, seems to be rarely covered when it comes to TCP-based communication between the server (presumably running on a desktop machine) and the client (Windows Phone) = transmission of large amounts of data.
A lot of existing samples assume that the communication, although bi-directional, is done with small data units.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-03-25-tcp-based-sockets-on-windows-phone-with-support-for-large-amounts-of-data/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2012-01-04-matchem-poker-a-great-poker-game-for-your-windows-phone-2/>Matchem Poker: A Great Poker Game For Your Windows Phone</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2012-01-04</span></div><div class=post-content>I am pleased to announce that my game is called “Match`em Poker”. It is a poker game for Windows Phone 7.5 Codename: Mango and it is now available for free on Windows Phone Market Place. I hope to share a lot of my exciting developing experience on this blog.
On top of being a fully functional, free poker game, I’ve also made sure to address key complaints That I heard from people regarding the previous poker and cards game on market place: the main function of the game, that is general touch responsiveness than any other game present on Market Place.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2012-01-04-matchem-poker-a-great-poker-game-for-your-windows-phone-2/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://shayananique.com/posts/2011-12-28-mpns-module-for-node-a-simple-push-notification-helper-for-the-cloud/>MPNS module for Node: A simple push notification helper for the cloud</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2011-12-28</span></div><div class=post-content>One of the fun projects I’ve been working on recently related to my app has been bringing online a cloud to handle sending push notifications processing. I’m using Node.js for this and have a ton of people enjoying the beta push experience right now: toasts, live tiles, etc.
Tonight I pushed to GitHub ‘mpns’, a simple interface and helper to the Microsoft Push Notification Service (MPNS). It essentially takes the simple properties for your live tile update or toast, packages it in a simple XML payload, and then posts it to the subscription endpoint.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2011-12-28-mpns-module-for-node-a-simple-push-notification-helper-for-the-cloud/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2022 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
